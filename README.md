## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m Le-Duong Pham, a passionate Data Science student currently studying at Catholic University of EichstÃ¤tt-Ingolstadt. My journey in data science began with a fascination for uncovering hidden patterns and insights from data. I enjoy working on projects that involve:

Machine Learning: Building predictive models and exploring various algorithms.
Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations to communicate data-driven stories.
Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to solve real-world problems.
Iâ€™m proficient in Python, R, and SQL, and I have experience with libraries and tools such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Iâ€™m always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on exciting projects.

Feel free to check out my repositories and connect with me!
